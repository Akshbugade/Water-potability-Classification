Water potability(Drinking Quality) Classification with Water parameters

Potable water, also known as drinking water, comes from surface and ground sources and is treated to levels that that meet state and federal standards for consumption.

We have data of Water testing parameters i.e. ph,Hardness,consductivity etc. according to water analysis will make ML model which predict the water poatability (i.e Wether Water is drinkable or not)
